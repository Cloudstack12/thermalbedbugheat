                    Like most pests, the best way to kill bed bugs quickly is with heat. This means you can kill all of them in just 10 minutes with adequate heat exposure. So what kills bed bugs instantly? Heat!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To kill bed bugs instantly with heat, you will need a steamer or space heater. It can reach temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. These high temperatures kill the adults, nymphs, and eggs at the same time. That is while not hurting any other part of your house.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Make sure everything is dry before doing this since moisture may decrease the effectiveness of this treatment option. Meeting these conditions means you can kill up to 98% on contact immediately upon stepping into the room.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Use a space heater and it is set to kill adult bugs and not kill live bed bug nymphs only since it will not kill the eggs. But heat can kill around 90% of the eggs immediately. That is when exposed for between 5 and 10 minutes. Keep killing them as they hatch.

                    Use a spray bottle to kill bed bugs instantly. Fill the bottle with rubbing alcohol, vodka, or even hand sanitizer. Spray on any cracks and crevices where the pests stay during the day. The strong solvent takes care of them in no time!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Rubbing alcohol has a drying effect which causes dehydration of bed bugs leading to their death since they need water to survive. When mixed with other ingredients such as dishwashing soap, it is more effective in lifting oils from the skin which attract these bloodsuckers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Rub on some alcohol directly on your or your children’s bites for instant relief! It will kill any bacteria but it also uses its drying effect to kill bed bugs instantly. Rotate every few hours while keeping them covered to avoid infection.

                    Alcohol Doesn’t Affect All Life Stages of Bed Bugs

                    Alcohol can kill bed bugs instantly on contact. The only downside is that it does not kill the eggs and some nymphs, so you also have to kill them. This is why it is best to combine alcohol with other treatment options. Combining alcohol with steam for example will kill both the adults and all the life stages of a bed bug infestation at once!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When using a steamer, add rubbing alcohol in its water tank to kill bed bugs fast! A hand-held device will kill what it comes into contact with. One used for an entire room kills all life stages of the pests including their eggs. Now that is what kills bed bugs instantly!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Do note though that some people might have skin allergies that may worsen upon exposure to some substances such as alcohol. Use these treatments carefully or consult your doctor first before trying out these options.

                    Does Alcohol Kill Bed Bugs?

                    Did you know that rubbing alcohol is effective in killing bed bugs instantly? It does kill the adults, nymphs, and eggs. You can kill them immediately upon exposure or later on when they come out at night.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It also works well with other treatment options so it makes sense to kill these pests together. But alcohol does not kill the eggs so combining it will eliminate all stages of an infestation. Use this method by itself or combine it with something else like steam, for example!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    These kill bed bugs instantly and will kill all life stages of a pest infestation upon immediate exposure. Choose methods that work well with other treatment options for the total annihilation of these pests from your home!

                <p>
                    The first way alcohol works to kill bed bugs is by acting as a solvent. It eats away at their outer shell and can become adequate for some, but not all types of bugs! Alcohol also has desiccant properties which means it will dry them out even more. They are susceptible in ways you want–to get rid of or stay away from these annoying little critters altogether.

                    Diffuse your favorite essential oils to kill bed bugs instantly! They cannot stand the smell of peppermint, lavender, and other essential oils that kill them on contact. You can diffuse these oils in any room of the house. Place a few drops of it on a cotton ball and leave it near their hiding areas.

                    Of course, what chemical kills bed bugs also depends on its active ingredient, but most are either pesticide or insecticide. Most kill bed bugs instantly while some kill them in a few hours instead. Some kill eggs only so you have to use it together with another bed bug technique for full effect.

                <p>
                    One chemical option is pyrethrins, which come from chrysanthemums. They kill bed bugs immediately but also kill ladybugs and other insects as well as fish and cats. Do not use around food and only kill the adults and not the eggs. You have to use it along with another technique for the safest results.

                    Bed bug infestations are like rashes on the skin: you cannot see them but they are there and will irritate your whole body when left unchecked. To help prevent these annoying creatures from transferring their eggs or adults into other parts of your homes, pre-sort clothes as if going to wash them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Place each sorted pile into its plastic bag with washing instructions. Know what temperature is safe for those items – ranging anywhere between 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) all way down around 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).

                    Vacuum every surface of your home to kill bed bugs instantly! This works best when you work with an upholstery attachment or crevice tool so that you do not miss any space. Do this before steaming so the heat does not kill them on contact!

                    Bed bugs can live anywhere they find food. But most prefer places around beds and mattresses. Vacuuming will suck them into the vacuum bag where you seal them away. Remove them out of your house or apartment as soon as possible to kill them for good!
